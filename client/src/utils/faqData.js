Changes to contracted services can be made up to a month prior. Cancellations within one month will still be subjected to a 50% cancellation charge. Cancellations within one week will be charged in full.",

I am obsessed with all things beauty and this means my kit is overflowing with products from different cosmetic brands. What I  can say is that all of my products are high-end, tried and true, and are used for the very specific purpose of creating a long-lasting beauty. Since I do have significant experience by MAC cosmetics, I do carry a lot of their products. I love their lipsticks and one of my favourite foundations are owned by Mac cosmetics.  Other favorite brands I use are Tom Ford, Fenty, Charlotte Tilbury,  Urban Decay, Anastasia Beverly Hills,  Laura Mercier, Becca, NARS, YSL, Benefit, Hourglass, Makeup Forever, Too-Faced, Tarte, and Marc Jacobs to name a few.

		question: "How important is it to schedule a Trial before the actual date?",
		answer:
			"I would not say that It is not necessary. I am  well aware of the stunning bridal styles before having a trial before hand; however I will say that I have never had a bride who regretted doing a trial before her wedding day. If there are ANY concerns about a particular style (the longevity, comfort level, how it looks on you), I highly recommend a trial. This way I can spend the time figuring out your perfect unique style (which might end up not being the initial style you had in mind) without stressing about it on your actual wedding day. That said, we do not think that a trial is a necessary for every bride, just depends on your particular needs. There is nothing like having a completely stress-free wedding day and having a trial and can sometimes alleviate some of those unknown factors which contribute to stress.",

			"Do you work out of a salon or do you provide in-room service? What are the travel fees to come to me?",

The last thing you want to be doing on your wedding day is to fight traffic and feel rushed and stressed. That is why I take all the anxiety out of your day by showing up on location with all the tools and product so that you can relax and enjoy a day of pampering and feeling like a celebrity. The Travel Fee vary on how far the location is. I charge 35cent per mile.",

It is simply not the case. Clean, dry hair is always best. If you think you need an additional blow out before styling to smooth the hair shaft, this can be arranged.",
